# for a class variable 
  we dont need to make onjects

# but in case of instance variable you need to make objects
 
# one instance class can be called in another instance class without an object

# for knowing the ip address of any system write command (ipconfig)

# then write the persons computer command on the browser and port no like  192.168.1.13:7070 
  where 7070 is port number

# if we use extend any classA in another classB then class B will inhwrit all the properties of class A

# class A
	class B extends class A			single level inheritance

# class A
	class B extends class A			multilevel inheritance
	class C extends class B

# class A
	class B extends class A			hierarchy level inheritance
	class C extends class A

# java does not support multiple, hybrid and multipath inheritance
