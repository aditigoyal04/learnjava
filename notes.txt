for a class variable 
we dont need to make onjects

but in case of instance variable you need to make objects
 
one instance class can be called in another instance class without an object

 for knowing the ip address of any system write command (ipconfig)

then write the persons computer command on the browser and port no like	192.168.1.13:7070 
where 7070 is port number
